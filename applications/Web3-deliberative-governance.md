### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).

Designing, testing and scaling deliberative governance to improve Web3 governance

- A brief description of your project.

As Humanity dives into a new paradigm, there is a profound need to reassess the way we take collective decisions. Activists, academics, and practitioners worldwide have been planting seeds of new ways of doing things. We think 3 emergent practices and approaches are particularly interesting to explore: Deliberative Governance, Blockchain technology, and the regenerative mindset.

The project aims at researching, testing and scaling if and how these 3 approaches can be combined to unlock the next generation of governance for the 21st Century. 

- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.

The project relates to Polkadot and Kusama because it's the most advanced system in terms of governance at scale. It also is the only large ecosystem with an evolutive governance framework which allows to test and deploy new ways of governance. Plus the Canari netwrok principle makes it possible to battle test new approaches. 

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

Our team is passionate about governance AND crypto. Our work aims at impacting how Human take collective decisions in a way that is inclusive, of high epistemic quality, transparent and reflexive. 

### Project Details - concept 

As blockchain technology and crypto-related ecosystems grow, they are demonstrating the potential they have to change the world. If we look at governance, DAOs and chains have very strong potential in terms of immutability, transparency, scalability, and incentive structures. At the same time, the challenges they face are also becoming clear. 
Particularly, decentralized governance has reached a clear bottleneck: crypto governance is plagued by low participation and turnout, bad quality forum discussions, nepotism, collusion, influencer biases, etc. This – in itself – is not dramatic as DAOs and chain governance are very new institutions and there needs to be a lot of piloting and experimentation to find the right balance between old and new institutional designs, between soft and hard governance, and between social and onchain consensus. 
But the recent dramatic events around Terra-Luna, the Solend governance proposal, the Juno chain proposal 16 have shown that stakes are high and affect the lives of tens of thousands of people.  

Deliberative Governance has been invented, piloted, and scaled since roughly 30 years as an answer and complement to the shortcomings of classical representative democracy and direct democracy. It brings collective intelligence (vs collected intelligence from voting, opinion polls or current crypto governance) to fruition, is epistemically strong (through cognitive diversity and the methods used in the process) and highly legitimate (through random selection of participants also known as Aleatorian Democracy). An overview of the many faces of deliberation can be explored at (https://participedia.net/). 

These 2 approaches have a clear potential to test and scale a new way of taking collective decisions as long as we are able to approach them in the more general framework of the regenerative approach meaning if we integrate them in a systemic view of life. 

The project we propose aims at researching, piloting and scaling a potential way to dramatically improve the governance of projects on polkadot and/or polkadot itself by enriching it with Deliberative governance practices and by putting them in a general regenerative framework. We may want to start experimentation on Kusama or on Parachains of the Kusama ecosystem. 

Governance 2.0 of polkadot will bring a lot of improvements but will still obfuscate part of the social and human consensus process necessary to prepare, support and legitimize the onchain consensus. Referenda are great tools of aggregation of preferences and governance 2.0 seems to bring the process to another level. But referenda are bad at allowing preferences to emerge and mature. Referenda are collected intelligence not collective intelligence. A pure technological and aggregative approach to governance ensures that it will fail. Human beings are biologically programmed to discuss with another and deliberate.

Therefore it is critical to prepare governance 3.0 and work on the right combination of deliberation and aggregation, collective and collected intelligence. 

To take an example in the frame of governance 2.0, we could imagine to “oraclise the user information” in parallel to the expert information. This would bring legitimacy and transparency to the process as well as a cognitive strength. Also in the phase of proposing, it would be very useful to have a deliberative brick to the process. 

- Mockups/designs of any UI components

Deliberative governance looks like this: 

- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality

- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
